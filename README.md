# Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) Project ⚛️📘

This project demonstrates the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** and its inverse using **Qiskit** in a single Jupyter Notebook.

You will:
- Prepare a custom quantum state
- Apply QFT and inverse QFT
- Visualize the state using city plots and Bloch spheres
- Verify correct transformation using measurement and simulation
